## Linux Commands Used

| Command                              | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                                 | Display user ID and group membership                  |
| `ls -l`                              | List files with detailed permissions                 |
| `chmod`                              | Change file permissions                              |
| `chown`                              | Change file ownership                                |
| `sudo`                               | Execute command as superuser                         |
| `pwd`                                | Show current directory                               |

## Lab Activities

- Verified current users and directories using `id` and `pwd`.
- Analyzed file ownership by listing files with `ls -l`.
- Created a practice file to experiment with permission changes.
- Modified file permissions with `chmod` to test different access levels.
- Used `sudo` to perform administrative tasks on system files.
- Examined how ownership changes impacted access rights.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned how to read Linux permission strings and understand what access each user group has.
- I practiced using `chmod` to adjust file permissions and observed how those changes affect who can read, write, or execute files.
- I became more confident using `sudo` to carry out administrative tasks on files that require elevated privileges.
- Understanding file ownership and permissions is crucial for securing Linux environments and ensuring only authorized users have appropriate access.

## SOC Analyst Takeaways

- As a SOC analyst, knowing how permissions work helps when reviewing system logs and ensuring that sensitive files are protected.
- Regularly verifying file ownership and permission settings is a good practice to prevent unauthorized access or accidental modifications.
- Linux file permissions are a core element of system security, and mastering them is key to maintaining a secure operating environment.
